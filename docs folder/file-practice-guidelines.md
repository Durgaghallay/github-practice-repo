# Here is where we will be adding a new file.

## File requirements

Using the Thoth Tech markdown guide, create a file that contains:

- A heading 1, heading 2, and heading 3
- Some paragraph text
- An ordered list
- An unordered list
- Some text which doubles as a URL to an external site

**Tables are another key element to be able to create in markdown. Review how to do so in the Markdown Guide**

---

We will then _commit_ the file and create a _Pull Request (PR)_ to add the file into the main branch
